# Microsoft Foundry IQ ♡ SharePoint Demo

This repository demonstrates how to connect a Sharepoint site to a Microsoft Foundry Agent through [Foundry IQ](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/agents/concepts/what-is-foundry-iq).  
It leverages an [Indexed Sharepoint Knowledge Source](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/agentic-knowledge-source-how-to-sharepoint-indexed?pivots=csharp).

## Architecture

```
Azure AI Foundry  ──►  Azure AI Search  ──►  SharePoint Online
   (GPT-4.1)         (Knowledge Base +       (indexed via federated
                       managed identity)       credential — passwordless)
```

Note: the agent is authenticated on sharepoint through its identity; it is not leveraging OBO authentication.

## Quick Start

### Deployment pre-requisites
Required permissions:

| Requirement | Why |
|---|---|
| **Azure subscription** | Owner / Contributor to create resource groups & resources |
| **Azure Developer CLI (`azd`)** | [Install](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/install-azd) — drives provisioning & deployment |
| **Entra ID privileges** | Ability to create App Registrations, grant **admin consent** for MS Graph `Files.Read.All` + `Sites.Read.All`, and add federated credentials |
| **SharePoint Online (M365)** | Same Entra tenant as the Azure subscription |

### Deployment

```bash
azd auth login
azd env set SHAREPOINT_SITE_URL https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/mysite
azd up
```

Note: `azd up` will prompt for the environment name and Azure region, then provision infrastructure and deploy search resources.

### Skillset & Content Understanding

The skillset uses Azure AI Search's **Content Understanding skill** to ingest and chunk SharePoint documents (PDF, DOCX, etc.) into manageable text sections with location metadata, while also extracting embedded images. Each text chunk is then vectorized with `text-embedding-3-large` for semantic search. Extracted images are passed through a **Chat Completion skill** that verbalizes them—generating natural-language descriptions of figures, diagrams, and charts—so visual content becomes searchable alongside text. The resulting chunks, vectors, and verbalized images are projected into the search index via index projections, giving the Foundry agent a rich, multimodal knowledge base over your SharePoint content.

**Index Fields**

| Field | Type | Source |
|---|---|---|
| `snippet` | `Edm.String` | Chunked text content from `ContentUnderstandingSkill` |
| `snippet_vector` | `Collection(Edm.Single)` | `text-embedding-3-large` (3072 dims) |
| `title` | `Edm.String` | `metadata_spo_item_name` (SharePoint file name) |
| `doc_url` | `Edm.String` | `metadata_spo_item_weburi` (SharePoint web URL) |
| `page_number` | `Edm.Int32` | `locationMetadata/pageNumberFrom` (PDF pages; null for DOCX) |

### Prompt examples

> how to do Professional Use of Social Media?

> what are the implications of violating the attendee policy?

> quelle est la politique de congés maternité ?

### Customisation

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `SHAREPOINT_SITE_URL` | *(required)* | SharePoint site to index |
| `SHAREPOINT_CONTAINER` | `allSiteLibraries` | `defaultSiteLibrary`, `allSiteLibraries`, or `useQuery` |
| `SHAREPOINT_QUERY` | *(empty)* | File filter when container is `useQuery` |
| `KNOWLEDGE_SOURCE_NAME` | `sharepoint-ks` | Name prefix for search resources |
| `KNOWLEDGE_BASE_NAME` | `sharepoint-kb` | Knowledge base name |
| `AGENT_NAME` | `foundryiq-sharepoint-agent` | Foundry agent name |
| `AGENT_DESCRIPTION` | `HR SharePoint agent…` | Agent description |
